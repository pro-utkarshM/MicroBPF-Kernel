# Idea Behind MicroBPF-Kernel

## Context & Motivation
Edge and IoT devices require lightweight, secure kernels that boot rapidly, consume minimal resources, and can adapt at runtime to new security and networking requirements. Existing RTOS solutions lack formal guarantees, while full Linux kernels are too heavy. Dynamically loading code into a monolithic kernel often entails security risks.

## Proposed Solution
MicroBPF-Kernel merges three pillars:

1. **Formally Verified Core**: Building on seL4’s proven microkernel to provide memory safety, isolation, and formal assurance against entire classes of bugs.
2. **Unikernel Efficiency**: Using Unikraft’s toolkit to produce single-image unikernels that boot in milliseconds and occupy only megabytes of flash/RAM.
3. **eBPF Extensibility**: Embedding an eBPF virtual machine in-kernel allows safe, sandboxed, on-the-fly extensions for packet processing, telemetry, and security policies without reflashing.

This hybrid delivers a minimal trusted computing base, runtime flexibility, and high performance on RISC-V platforms.

## Target Applications
- Secure network gateways and firewalls
- Lightweight HTTPS/DTLS servers on embedded hardware
- Real-time telemetry and anomaly detection agents
- Dynamic security policies for industrial control systems

## Goals
- Formal verification of core IPC and memory primitives
- Sub-10 ms cold boot times on typical IoT boards
- Throughput parity with Linux+XDP for basic packet filtering
- Zero trust during extension loading via eBPF verifier
