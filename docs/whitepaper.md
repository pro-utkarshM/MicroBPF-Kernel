## 1. Introduction

Edge and IoT platforms demand a new kind of kernel — one that is fast, safe, and dynamically extensible under constrained resources. Traditional RTOSes, while minimal, lack provable security properties and runtime adaptability. Conversely, monolithic Linux-based systems bring unnecessary complexity, sluggish boot times, and oversized attack surfaces.

MicroBPF-Kernel introduces a new architecture built from first principles: combining seL4’s formal verification, unikernel efficiency, and in-kernel eBPF programmability. Designed for RISC-V edge devices, MicroBPF-Kernel enables instant boot, high isolation, and real-time policy updates without reflashing the firmware.

## 2. Limitations of Traditional RTOS Models

RTOSes such as FreeRTOS, OpenRTOS, VxWorks, and Zephyr were engineered for predictable timing and constrained execution. However, they fall short in three fundamental areas:

* They lack formal guarantees — introducing risk of memory corruption, race conditions, or privilege escalations.
* They do not support safe, runtime extension of logic or policy.
* Their scheduler and IPC models are often tied to trust-heavy assumptions and weak isolation boundaries.

Even systems like QNX, while supporting microkernel structures, are too heavyweight or commercially restrictive for deeply embedded RISC-V deployments.

## 3. Core Architecture

MicroBPF-Kernel unifies three orthogonal but complementary systems:

### 3.1 Formally Verified Kernel Core

Built atop seL4, the core kernel:

* Is formally verified against entire classes of memory and concurrency errors.
* Enforces strict capability-based access control.
* Provides deterministic scheduling and IPC models with machine-checked safety.

### 3.2 Unikernel-Style Deployment

Using a Unikraft-inspired build process, each MicroBPF application is compiled into a unikernel image:

* Boots in <10 ms.
* Contains only statically linked modules needed by the application.
* Occupies under 2 MB of flash and RAM in typical configurations.

### 3.3 In-Kernel eBPF Execution

MicroBPF includes an eBPF interpreter and (optionally) JIT compiler:

* Extensions are verified using a static verifier before being loaded.
* eBPF programs can safely modify runtime behavior for:

  * Network packet filtering (XDP-style),
  * In-kernel metrics or observability,
  * Custom security hooks and IO routing.

| Property              | Guarantee                                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Isolation             | Formal spatial/temporal separation via seL4 capabilities               |
| Runtime Extensibility | BPF-based extensions injected post-boot without reflashing             |
| Attack Surface        | Minimal TCB — no dynamic loader, no unnecessary system services        |
| Observability         | In-kernel BPF counters, histograms, trace hooks                        |
| Policy Adaptability   | Update authorization, filtering, or response logic dynamically via BPF |
| Cold Boot Time        | Sub-10 ms boot on RV32IMAC platforms                                   |

## 5. eBPF Subsystem Design

MicroBPF’s eBPF engine is customized for embedded RISC-V systems:

* Supports a verified subset of the BPF ISA with bounded loops, verified memory access, and fixed stack usage.
* Loads programs from flash, over UART/SPI, or embedded pre-boot.
* Supports per-CPU maps, tail calls, and helper calls (memory-safe, no dynamic allocation).
* Program verifier integrated at load-time; future plans include formal verification in Coq or Dafny.

Use Cases:

* Update network ACLs based on telemetry.
* Run anomaly detection filters in-kernel.
* Enable time-based behavior switching without reboot.

## 6. Messaging and Configuration

MicroBPF uses nanopb-based Protobuf messages for structured configuration and runtime interaction:

* All control-plane configuration (network, clocks, eBPF policies) is loaded via Protobuf-encoded packets.
* Messages are validated statically and versioned via .proto schema for forward compatibility.
* Optional serial console for command input and telemetry logging.

## 10. Conclusion

MicroBPF-Kernel enables a new paradigm: a kernel that is secure by proof, lean by design, and dynamic at runtime. Designed specifically for the rising tide of RISC-V IoT and edge deployments, it offers a real alternative to bloated monolithic systems and legacy RTOS models — without compromise.

By uniting formal methods, unikernel deployment, and in-kernel programmable logic, MicroBPF-Kernel aims to set a new standard for high-trust, low-footprint computing at the edge.
