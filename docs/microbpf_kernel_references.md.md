# MicroBPF-Kernel Integration Plan

## Introduction

The **MicroBPF-Kernel** project aims to develop a minimal RISC-V kernel with integrated eBPF capabilities. To enhance its functionality and robustness, we plan to incorporate components from several open-source RISC-V kernel projects. This document details the specific elements to be integrated, their sources, and acknowledgments to the original authors.

## Components to Integrate

### 1. Boot and Initialization Sequences

- **Source**: [mini-riscv-os](https://github.com/cccriscv/mini-riscv-os)
- **Details**: Utilize the bootloader configurations and memory initialization routines to streamline the kernel's startup process.

### 2. Interrupt Handling and Timer Implementations

- **Source**: [riscv-os](https://github.com/peiyuanix/riscv-os)
- **Details**: Incorporate timer interrupts and basic process scheduling mechanisms to enhance kernel responsiveness and multitasking capabilities.

### 3. UART and Serial Communication Drivers

- **Source**: [tinyos](https://github.com/Archfx/tinyos)
- **Details**: Adopt UART implementations to facilitate debugging and user interaction through serial consoles.

### 4. Memory Management Techniques

- **Source**: [riscv-os](https://github.com/peiyuanix/riscv-os)
- **Details**: Adapt memory allocation and management strategies to improve kernel efficiency and stability.

### 5. eBPF Integration Insights

- **Source**: [µBPF: Using eBPF for Microcontroller Compartmentalization](https://marioskogias.github.io/docs/microbpf.pdf)
- **Details**: Leverage findings to guide the incorporation of eBPF into the kernel, enhancing programmability and security features.
